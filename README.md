# Blumareks repository for Devoxx 2017
Hijacking your home IoT and home robots - the actual talk planned for Devoxx
With introduction of IBM Watson and IBM Bluemix one could hijack virtually anything with Watson cognitive services. 
"This morning I had the conversation on politics with my vacuum cleaning robot" - In this session, we will demonstrate the power of voice UI, mobile and cognitive services from the IBM Bluemix platform to securely connect and manage devices, analyze social network data, and apply cognitive services to add human-like interaction to IoT products.
 
Leveraging AlchemyAPI, Visual Analysis, Personality Insights, IoT Platform and Watson Dialog capabilities, we will show how you can quickly and securely turn a simple idea into reality by transforming a regular robot vacuum into a cognitive-enabled smart and chatty device.
using Watson Conversation and Visual Recognition the home device could be turned into the media information device that could have an opinion based even on the social network sentiment messaging. example using node.red, mobile and the STEM robot platform


- LAB 1 is about connecting a simulated sensor and a real one to IBM Watson IoT Platform and pushing data from a sensor to IBM Bluemix.
- LAB 2 is dedicated to dynamic invocation of the communication between IBM Bluemix to Raspberry Pi and invoke an action (taking a picture), returning a message (and uploading a picture to IBM Bluemix for furhter IBM Watson Visual Recognition Analysis).
- LAB 3 presents a further step of adding an app in Swift running on a mobile device to manage the Raspberry Pi over IBM Bluemix with help of previous steps and IBM Watson IoT Platform setup. In addition we would connect Raspberry Pi to STEM mobile robot platform - iRobot Create2. An additional flow would manage communication over Serial port - and the 2 initial commands would be issued to iRobot Create platform from a mobile device: 'Beep' and 'Forced Dock'.
